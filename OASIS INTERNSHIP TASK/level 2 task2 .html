                The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of the Government of India.
                Established on August 15, 1969, ISRO has become a key player in the field of space exploration.
                It is known for its remarkable achievements and contributions to space science and technology.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                ISRO's journey began with the launch of its first satellite, Aryabhata, in 1975. Since then, it has
                achieved numerous milestones in space technology and research. ISRO's founder, Dr. Vikram Sarabhai,
                envisioned the organization as a means to leverage space technology for national development.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chandrayaan Missions:</strong> ISRO's Chandrayaan-1 ,Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3 missions
                    to the Moon have expanded our understanding of lunar geology and water presence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan):</strong> In 2013, ISRO successfully launched
                    Mangalyaan, making India the fourth country to reach Mars.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Navigation with IRNSS:</strong> The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS),
                    now known as NAVIC, provides accurate positioning and timing information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Aditya L1 Mission:</strong> ISRO's Aditya L1 mission aims to study the Sun and its
                    impact on Earth's climate and weather.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Notable Missions</h2>
            <p>
                <b>India’s Polar Satellite </b> Launch Vehicle, in its thirty-sixth flight (PSLV-C34), launches the 727.5 kg
                Cartosat-2 Series Satellite for earth observation and 19 co-passenger satellites together weighing about
                560 kg at lift–off into a 505 km polar Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO). PSLV-C34 was launched from the Second
                Launch Pad (SLP) of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota on June 22, 2016, at 09:26 hrs (IST).
                This is the fourteenth flight of PSLV in ‘XL’ configuration (with the use of solid strap-on motors).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) </b>, India's first interplanetary mission to planet Mars was launched onboard PSLV-C25
                on November 05, 2013. ISRO has become the fourth space agency to successfully send a spacecraft to Mars orbit.
                Though the designed mission life is 6 months, MOM completed 7 years in its orbit on Sept 24, 2021.
            </p>

                <b>प्रमोचक राकेट / Launch Vehicle: GSLV-Mk III - M1 / Chandrayaan-2 Mission
                निर्माता / Manufacturer: ISRO
                स्‍वामी / Owner: ISRO
                अनुप्रयोग / Application: Planetary Observation
                कक्षा का प्रकार / Orbit Type: Lunar </b>
                <br>
                Chandrayaan-2 mission is a highly complex mission, which represents a significant technological leap compared to the
                previous missions of ISRO. It comprised an Orbiter, Lander, and Rover to explore the unexplored South Pole of the Moon.
                The mission is designed to expand the lunar scientific knowledge through a detailed study of topography, seismography,
                mineral identification and distribution, surface chemical composition, thermo-physical characteristics of topsoil,
                and composition of the tenuous lunar atmosphere, leading to a new understanding of the origin and evolution of the Moon.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Aditya L1 </b>shall be the first space-based Indian mission to study the Sun. The spacecraft shall be placed in a halo
                orbit around the Lagrange point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system, which is about 1.5 million km from the Earth. A satellite
                placed in the halo orbit around the L1 point has the major advantage of continuously viewing the Sun without any
                occultation/eclipses.
            </p>
            <h2>Global Significance</h2>
            <p>
                ISRO's cost-effective and reliable space missions have gained international recognition. It has not only contributed
                to space science but also aided various sectors such as communication, weather forecasting, agriculture, and disaster management.
